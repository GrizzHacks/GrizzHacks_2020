                        <p>
                            GrizzHacks 5 is the fifth hackathon held at Oakland University.
                            A hackathon is an opportunity for students to create incredible hardware
                            and software projects from the bottom up in one weekend.
                            A team of passionate sponsors and mentors is brought in to help students achieve their goals.
                            Come join almost 300 students and local industry professionals for
                            36 hours of learning and technological passion.

                        <p>
                            GrizzHacks is open to all graduate, undergraduate, high school, and middle school students,
                            as well as those who have graduated within the last calendar year.
                            You don’t need to be an engineering major; If you have a passion for technology
                            and the drive to change the world, you belong at GrizzHacks.

                        <p>
                            While it can be helpful, no previous programming/engineering experience is required
                            at GrizzHacks. We will have presentations from sponsors, and mentors
                            available to help you with your project.
                            Every student who attends a hackathon leaves with a wealth of new knowledge,
                            regardless of what they came with. Bring an open mind and be ready to learn,
                            we’ll help you through the rest.

                            Just like having previous knowledge, having a team or an idea is not a requirement either!
                            We will have an opportunity for team building and allow you to meet new people to work with.
                            There will be a number of presentations to help inspire you with an idea; we know you’ll build something great!

                            Teams can range from one to four people.
                            You can work with your best friends from class, or with someone you just met during the opening ceremony!
                            Working alone is allowed, but in our experience, a hackathon is always more fun collaborating with someone else.

                            Students are not allowed to begin progress on their hack before GrizzHacks.
                            However, the use of third-party APIs and libraries is allowed and encouraged.
                            We also encourage you to be familiar with the tools you plan to use at the event, such as a specific programming language, as long as it is not a part of your hack.

                        <p>
                            A panel of to-be-determined judges will assess your hacks creativity, difficulty, design, and potential.
                            Ten hacks will be selected for a demo in front of the entire GrizzHacks audience for a final round of judging.
                            Stay tuned to see who our judges are!
