# GrizzHacks_2020
GrizzHacks site for 2020 and beyond
------------------------------------
## Tools used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Bootstrap Framework)
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- PHP

I am using FancyBox for some of the animations, like: 
- loading.gif
- overlay
- parallax

In addition, using Owl Carousel for the sliders on the site.
The site uses fontawesome icons for the social media icons, and google fonts because they looked nice :)
